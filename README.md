This is a 2D engine and game in C following the tutorial by Dylan Falconer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWGoPJKf97o). I am following this tutorial as part of the research phase of a personal project of mine where I will eventually program an RPG game on a 3D voxel engine from scratch. This also gives me the ability to get more experience programming in C and learn graphics libraries like OpenGL.
